# workled MCP Controller

## MCP Tool Reference

| Tool | Property | Description | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|
| set_agent_state | state_name: string | Set LED to reflect agent state (`thinking`/`waiting`/`idle`/`error`) | `set_agent_state("thinking")` |
| get_agent_state | — | Returns current agent LED state (empty string if unset) | `get_agent_state()` |
| set_brightness | brightness: integer | LED brightness 0-255; 0 = off | `set_brightness(128)` |
| get_brightness | — | Returns current LED brightness 0-255; | `get_brightness()` |
| set_effect | effect_name: string, effect_json: string | effect_name ∈ `led`(manual effect)/`thinking`/`waiting`/`idle`/`error`/`touch`(touch effect); effect_json is a JSON string `{"type","hue","saturation","value","speed"}`. Light must be on first (set_brightness > 0). Map natural-language colors to HSV (see table below). | `set_effect("led", '{"type":"breathe","hue":180,"speed":50}')` |
| get_effect | effect_name: string | Get effect_name config as JSON | `get_effect("thinking")` |
| set_macro | macro_name: string, macro_json: string | Set the macro for a touch pad gesture; macro_name ∈ `single_click`/`double_click`/`long_press`; macro_json is a JSON array of segments (see Macro Format); empty macro_json resets | `set_macro("single_click", '[{"combo":"ctrl+c"}]')` |
| get_macro | macro_name: string | Returns the macro as a JSON array string, or empty string if unset (password values masked) | `get_macro("single_click")` |

### Mapping natural-language colors to `set_effect`

Use `type:"solid"` unless the user asks for an animation. Map a color name to HSV:

| Description | type | hue | saturation | value |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| pure white | solid | 0 | 0 | 255 |
| warm white | solid | 30 | 80 | 255 |
| red | solid | 0 | 255 | 255 |
| orange | solid | 30 | 255 | 255 |
| yellow | solid | 60 | 255 | 255 |
| green | solid | 120 | 255 | 255 |
| cyan/teal | solid | 180 | 255 | 255 |
| blue | solid | 240 | 255 | 255 |
| purple/violet | solid | 270 | 255 | 255 |
| pink | solid | 330 | 200 | 255 |
| dim/night mode | solid | 30 | 80 | 60 |
| rainbow (animated) | rainbow | - | - | - |

Rule of thumb: hue 0-359 picks the hue, saturation 0-255 (0 = white/pastel, 255 = vivid), value 0-255 brightness. Pastel/white tones use low saturation; vivid tones use 255.

## Troubleshooting

If the device is not responding, or automatic state lighting stays dark, run
`node <skill-dir>/index.js status` and follow the JSON `hint` it prints. A
configured client whose `plugin`/hooks are missing shows up there — re-run the
installer (`skill-install.mjs install --client <name>`) to wire the automatic
lighting.

## Waiting-state coverage by client

`waiting` means "the agent asked you something and is blocked on your
answer". workled can only light it when the client itself emits an event for
the question — it cannot invent one. Coverage therefore differs per client.

| Client | Waiting state | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| opencode | ok | — |
| kilo | ok | — |
| dsh | ok | — |
| pi | no | No event is fired for the option prompt |
| openclaw | no | No event is fired for the option prompt |
| hermes | partial | Normal option prompts emit nothing; permission prompts do |
| workbuddy | ok | - |
| trae-cn | ok | - |

On the clients marked no (and on hermes for normal option prompts), the LED
stays on `thinking` while a question is pending. If you want "waiting for you"
to be visible there, call `set_agent_state("waiting")` yourself before asking
the question.

Measured 2026-09-07; re-check after a client update, since this depends on each
client's own hook/plugin surface.
